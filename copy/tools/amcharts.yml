      Back to wrestling with Chart.js and data visualizations. It's taking me
      longer than expected to build a continuous, time series chart, using a
      discrete dataset, and it's tricky to keep the chart dynamically updating.

      Anyways, thers is no chance to take Chart.js as our tool to do things in
      business or private tasks by the fact of these difficulties in
      configuration and poor documentation.
